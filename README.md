# QR-code bootstrap channel

This repository holds an bootstrap channel implementation that uses [QR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)
as a way to exchange file/channel metadata between two devices; sender exposes data as QR codes, and
receiver gets them through its camera.

#### Example app

The `example/` directory contains an example app that lets you play with the QR code channel.
